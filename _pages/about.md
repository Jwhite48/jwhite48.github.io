Thank you for visiting my site!

I have been coding since high school. I love working on projects that have some form of user interaction involved, whether it be games or looking at data. It's nice to be able to showcase your work in a way that can be experienced by others.

Most of the projects on this site were not orginally written in <b>JavaScript</b>. I "translated" them from their original coding langauges (<b>C++</b>, <b>Java</b>, etc.) so that they could be experienced by others directly in their browsers, as well as coding practice for myself. Enjoy your stay!
